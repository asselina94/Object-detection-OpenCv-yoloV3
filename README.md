# Object-detection-OpenCv-yoloV3

The directories (in order of importance) are:

yolo-coco/ : The YOLOv3 object detector pre-trained (on the COCO dataset) model files. These were trained by the Darknet team.

images/ : This folder contains four static images which we’ll perform object detection on for testing and evaluation purposes.

videos/ : After performing object detection with YOLO on images, we’ll process videos in real time. This directory contains four sample videos for you to test with.

output/ : Output videos that have been processed by YOLO and annotated with bounding boxes and class names can go in this folder.

Packages used: cv2,numpy,argparse,time. 

language used: Python, Opencv is used along yolo for object detection using image processing.
